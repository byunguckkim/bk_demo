// Collection of possible states the map traffic signals can have. Can compose phases/stages
// from Bulbs and BlockStates which are inferred from the signals defined in the map.
// Each bulb has an on and an off state generated.
//
// For example, adding a signal with id "100" that contains a green no-icon subsignal with
// the id "0" will generate a bulb with the name "BULB_100_0" and the following bulb states:
// - { color: COLOR_GREEN, icon: ICON_NONE, mode: MODE_CONSTANT, name: STATE_ON}
// - { color: COLOR_GREEN, icon: ICON_NONE, mode: MODE_OFF, name: STATE_OFF}
//
// It will also generate a block with the name "BLOCK_100" with a block state for each subsignal
// being in STATE_ON while the rest are in STATE_OFF. For the green subsignal in the example,
// the block state where it is on would be named "COLOR_GREEN_ICON_NONE".
